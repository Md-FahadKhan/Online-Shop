        <h5 style="color: #555;">The proposed online shop system features distinct interfaces for customers, sellers, and administrators. Upon accessing the home page, users are prompted to 
        sign up before navigating personalized interfaces. Customers, upon logging in, can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. The system also maintains a 
        comprehensive order history for each customer. Sellers, granted access via a unique password from the admin, gain entry to a dedicated dashboard enabling them to manage their product
        listings and process orders related to their offerings. The admin, equipped with a centralized dashboard, oversees the entire system, managing product details, user accounts, and order 
        processing. Notably, the admin has the authority to accept or reject orders based on situational requirements. .</h5>
